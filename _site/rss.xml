      <title>My current iOS 'workflow'</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may have recognized, I'm an Ubuntu user. But I also like using Apple Hardware. This results in some special configurations and workarounds I want to present in this post. I also find it interesting to see how other people handle tasks of all kind on their devices, even with a standard setup like iOS device + OS X. Lately, a friend of mine and already-iPhone-user discovered that he &lt;strong&gt;needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; an iPad, so I want to give some advice. It takes quite some money and time to search through all the apps until you find the one you were looking for. Maybe I can help avoid some unnecessary testing on your side, too.&lt;br/&gt;
Funny coincident: In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://minimalmac.com/enough/#ep34&quot;&gt;34th&lt;/a&gt; episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://minimalmac.com/enough&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;enough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a podcast by Patrick Rhone and Myke Hurley, Myke talks about how he has set up his iDevices so that he basically doesn't have to sync them. Though he uses a Mac, his setup is very similar to mine. I strive to not having to sync either, because in order to I would have to boot windows which always ruins my day. But let's go more into detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Organizing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, I set up a google account so I could use Google Analytics. Then, I started using Google Chrome and its nice syncing features.&lt;br/&gt;
After I got my iPad and had two devices I wanted to have my contacts and calendars on, I tried the stuff Google offers in that field, too. It worked great, so contacts, calendar and mails on iPad and iPhone now sync with my Google account. That's in addition to all the awesome gmail features you may or may not know about, like that it pulls mails from every mail account you may use, labels etc.&lt;br/&gt;
For best functionality with iDevices, I suggest you set up your gmail account as an (Microsoft)Exchange Server how it's described &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cultofmac.com/how-to-set-up-push-gmail-on-your-iphoneipod-touch/16966&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, not as IMAP. It works like a charm. Though it dosn't happen instantaneously, new events or contacts get synced very reliably.&lt;br/&gt;
On Ubuntu, all the gmail functions seamlessly integrate with evolution, even the next few days' events show up under the calendar when you click on the time in the system's panel. I don't know how well or if any of that works with Outlook, but I think Google has figured something out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Texts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I came to the conclusion that notes I can search through (read: which were taken with the iPad) are more valuabe to me than notes I took with pen and paper. It certainly isn't for everyone, but I'm willing to trade having to slightly change the way I take notes for the comfort of having them all with me on the iPad and in my Dropbox&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. For this purpose, I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elements-dropbox-powered-text/id382752422?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. One of its perks is that it's able to understand and convert to &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;markdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, John Gruber's markup language. Don't know what that means? Me neither. It's an easy way to write down HTML, that's all you need to know. This way, I can look up all the notes I took while attending lectures. Saved my ass several times, and that's just since the iPad 2 is available.&lt;br/&gt;
Great post about markdown: &lt;a href=&quot;http://forkbombr.net/markdown-new-word51/&quot;&gt;Markdown is the new Word 5.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Sadly, Elements seems to write some invisible stuff at the beginning of a text document so that the markdown-engine Jekyll (the site generator I use for this blog) uses can't handle posts written with Elements without further editing.&lt;br/&gt;
So I'll have to find a better solution for this, maybe I'll switch back to Elements despite the corrupting invisible stuff, but for now I use another Dropbox-syncing text editor for Blogposts, &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/id396073482?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nocs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It really isn't that great. Writing Kit, Markdown Edit and other text editors I tried didn't please me to full extent either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PDFs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
All the documents I need for my studies sit in &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/goodreader-for-iphone/id306277111?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GoodReader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Mostly they are PDFs, but GoodReader also handles .doc and other formats. Of course, GoodReader syncs with Dropbox (in my case with the 'Study' folder within my Dropbox) so the files sit locally in GoodReader on the iPad and are available offline, but also always up to date.&lt;br/&gt;
I don't like GoodReader that much, there are many little things that could be improved&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Sadly it's the only app that does what it does. So, if you're an iOS developer: here's an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Videos&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here comes the fun stuff. My setting: TV shows and movies, somehow, are available on my hard drive. From this point forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/air-video-watch-your-videos/id306550020?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you're able to select the tv show or movie you want to watch, and let your desktop convert and stream it directly onto your iOS device. You can also select some videos and add them to the queue so that they sit in Dropbox already converted when you want to watch them.&lt;br/&gt;
I like watching the current week's episodes of HIMYM, BBT, Simpsons, 30 Rock, Dexter, South Park and Family Guy on the iPad before bed or, sometimes, when I have dinner. That's more comfortable than firing up XBMC on my desktop machine 'just' for 20 minutes of a TV show.&lt;br/&gt;
The Air Video Server is available for Windows and OS X only, but it works well on Ubuntu via Wine.&lt;br/&gt;
I, for my part, put the Air Video output folder in my Dropbox and make the video files a favorite in the Dropbox app on my iPad. So they are available offline. And maybe that's worth mentioning: Air Video converts a 500 mb, 20 minutes episode in HD quality to only ~160 mb and the quality is quite decent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handbrake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Oh, this one isn't an app. &lt;a href=&quot;http://handbrake.fr/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handbrake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome piece of software, available for every current Os. For me, it's the counterpart to Air Video. When I'm working with my desktop machine and there happens to be some video file I'm inclined to watch later on the iPad, I convert it with Handbrake. It's easy to use and even comes with presets for the iPad. The target folder, of course, is the same as the Air Video folder that sits in my Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMDb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imdb-movies-tv/id342792525?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMDb app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome tool for every movie nut. Which film this actor starred in, which director did this film and which other films? IMDb got all the answers. And it offers trailers.&lt;br/&gt;
Often, you see an app and think 'Oh, I need this!', and afterwards use it only once. With the IMDb app,  it actually was the other way round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you listen to podcasts and own an iPhone, you should use &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/instacast/id420368235?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instacast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, and subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/&quot;&gt;5by5&lt;/a&gt;-podcasts you may be interested in. My favorites are &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/hypercritical&quot;&gt;Hypercritical&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/&quot;&gt;Build and Analyze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/talkshow/&quot;&gt;The Talk Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
I use a portable speaker, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/Wavemaster-Mobile-Speaker-System-schwarz/dp/B002MW3G78&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobi Wavemaster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Music and voice sound really good, and the volume it produces allows me to listen to podcasts even while I cook. Incredible battery. Top notch. I also use the wavemaster all the time with the iPad, so I don't have to deal with the 2's annoying speaker when I listen to the masterpieces that Cartman's monologues are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;RSS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RSS is &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; tool for keeping up with today's information overflow. Of course, you should use Google Reader as the tool to manage your feeds. On top of it, everyone loves &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder-for-ipad/id375661689?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reeder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Seamless Google Reader functions, Instapaper, twitter and mail integration, great usability. Once you've used it on the iPad, you won't need the desktop or iPhone version. Short articles I read directly in Reeder. Anything longer than 'short' I'm interested in goes to Instapaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Instapaper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instapaper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is for the 'Sunday morning, having coffee, sitting on a couch' mode of reading, kind of. I'm always happy to launch Instapaper, cause there are only interesting articles in it. Via my Twitter client or browser plugin, I send articles to Instapaper and it collects them. It then offers a text-only view for distraction and ad-free reading.&lt;br/&gt;
You can also like articles so your buddies can see which awesome posts you read recently, similar to Google Reader's favorite and shared item functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the iPad, I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-for-twitter/id359914600?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitterriffic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Instapaper integration, nice interface, what's not to love?&lt;br/&gt;
On the iPhone, I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id428851691?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tweetbot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Great interface, smart use of gestures, love it. Can't wait for the iPad version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Marvel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, more 'revolutionary' than anything regarding the big question of journalism in the digital age and the apps trying to answer that question is the way the &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marvel-comics/id350027738?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marvel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; app let's me read, nay, &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; comics. I only read the free ones Marvel releases every month, but when I do, I'm totally sucked into it. You only get to see one frame at a time and then you swipe to the next, I find that very intense. Got me hooked onto Iron Man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would iOS be without all the little helpers you don't even think about anymore?&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplenote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Apple's note app is nice, but doesn't sync (at least not without mobile me), so screw it. I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/simplenote/id289429962?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplenote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it even has a chrome web app, so your shopping list is available on your desktop machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DB Navigator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I live in Hamburg, Germany, so the 'Deutsche Bahn' or 'DB' is what I rely on mostly when a destination is too far away for a bike ride. They offer an awesome app for &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/db-navigator/id343555245?mt=8&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/db-navigator-fur-ipad/id416877198?mt=8&quot;&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Due&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I never will understand why Apple's clock app doesn't offer multiple timers. But since it simply doesn't, we need another app. With &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/id390017969?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Due&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can have a timer for your French press, eggs and your rolls. Alarm and timer mode, Dropbox syncing, it's all there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wunderlist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/wunderlist/id406644151?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wunderlist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a nice, simple to do app. It's not as 'professional' as, say, &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-for-iphone/id284885288?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omnifocus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it's free. I really don't need all the complexity most to do apps offer, so I'm perfectly happy with Wunderlist. But if you go all professional on your to dos, I'm positive Omnifocus is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a huge one, I hope it's of use to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As much as one can &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; a gadget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, all the documents I need and use are stored in Dropbox. Needless to say that if you don't already use Dropbox, you &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to do so. &lt;a href=&quot;http://db.tt/X3XjJMl&quot;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recent documents view, animations for example, and overall look &amp;amp; feel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I literally had to look at every single app on my devices to collect the ones in this category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Probably the endmost #rp11 review</title>
      <link>http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/23/rp11</link>
      <pubDate>May 23, 2011</pubDate>
      <guid>http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/23/rp11</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over a month ago, the whole German-speaking Internet community went to Berlin. The re-publica&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; took place. It was my second re-publica, so I was eager to experience the networking effect in full extent, meet more people and have even more fun than in 2010. And I did. But apparently, many people have a different understanding from what a conference is or should be like. After it, I read and heard many people basically saying something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important thing with such a conference is meeting people, I didn't care about the sessions and panels. I wasn't interested in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they are right, but just to a certain extent. You can't isolate the factor of meeting people from such a conference, but to state that the sessions don't matter goes too far, in my opinion. Last year, I found more sessions more interesting, though. But I'm not sure how much that's my fault, because I didn't research the speakers in advance this year. Add a little bit of bad luck to it, and there you are.&lt;br/&gt;
Maybe the problem lies with naming the sessions. When the session's name appeals to me very much, I'm likely to attend it. But it's also likely I already know very much of its content. That goes hand in hand with a broader audience, and that's okay. Although nerds tend to forget they're highly specialized, they need to keep events like this accessible and open for 'normal' people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address another common complaint: Of course there were too many people in the Kalkscheune, the smaller building next to the Friedrichstastpalast. But I think the team knows they didn't manage that well. With such a rapid growth of the conference, I'm willing to oversee this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to the important stuff, the talks.&lt;br/&gt;
One of the talks I liked best was about the structure of a group called &lt;a href=&quot;http://telecomix.org/&quot;&gt;telecomix&lt;/a&gt;. Without accidentally talking to the speaker the day before, I wouldn't have attended it, simply because I had no frakkin' clue what the topic was, even what the title meant. Now, I know more about how online campaigning based on a relatively loose structure works, and &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; it works in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;
Another very interesting one was held by &lt;a href=&quot;http://mogis-verein.de&quot;&gt;mogis&lt;/a&gt;' Christian Bahls and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jerezim&quot;&gt;Jérémy Zimmermann&lt;/a&gt;. It was titled 'Lobbying the European Parliament' and they basically talked about how they did and still do that. Which numbers to call, which doors to knock on and so on. Different from the techie talks, but more hands-on and energizing. Great guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The #rp11 was a great experience, I met a ton of interesting people&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, I attended great sessions. I want to thank the #rp11-team very much. Great experience at a small price&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, what's not to love?&lt;br/&gt;
See you next year, wherever the #rp12 may take us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://re-publica.de/11/&quot;&gt;re-publica.de&lt;/a&gt;, Hashtag: #rp11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fun fact: many of them from Hamburg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sadly, the price didn't cover food. Of course, I really would've liked to see that for the 55€ I paid for my ticket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>It's friday</title>
      <link>http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/20/its-friday</link>
      <pubDate>May 20, 2011</pubDate>
      <guid>http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/20/its-friday</guid>
      <description>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sun.jpg&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; alt=&quot;I really couldn't get more cool stuff into this one&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
It's warm, the sun's shining. I'm on the train from Pinneberg, where my sister lives&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, to Hamburg, where I live and later am meeting with some friends to have a nice evening&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Today, I got back good results from a term paper, now I'm sitting here, listening to my favorite band and writing it down. Life's sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sincerely hope you forgive me this one pathetic 'Oh my god my life's so awesome right now'-post. Have a great weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We lawyered around a little, always a great exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read: And night, we might drink one or two beers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>My Ubuntu Story</title>
      <link>http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/19/my-ubuntu-story</link>
      <pubDate>May 19, 2011</pubDate>
      <guid>http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/19/my-ubuntu-story</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I push an update to my git-repository or even just copy or delete a file via sudo cp or rm or write a rsync-script for backup purposes, speak: use the terminal, I always feel like the meanest h4xx0r on the planet. I mean, seriously: That's &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt;, typing letters in a 662*428 window and so making stuff happen. Even two years ago, I would never have believed that this could happen one day.&lt;br/&gt;
It really didn't look like it: At first, some of the stuff I typed didn't make anything happen at all. To be honest: It sometimes kept everything from happening, i.e. my system from finding its boot sector or even the whole hard drive. When that happened, it always ruined my day and made me kick all this hippie open source shit off of my hard drive and switch back to windows-only. I couldn't play games on Ubuntu in the first place, so why bother?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, a few years and Ubuntu releases later, playing games became relatively unimportant to me, another thing I would never have believed either. Or, to put it differently: my play instinct focused from actual games on the whole system. The features of a unix system became more compelling to me, and windows' drawbacks more and more unbearable. Why didn't I consider OS X? Well, the lack of hardware wasn't what made me check out Linux, and the possibility of hackintosh didn't occur to me. Buying a Mac? Orrr. OS X would've cost money one way or another, while there was no barrier of financial kind switching to Linux. And time I had enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm running a system that's more elegant and fits my needs way better than any configuration involving windows ever could. And this is a long shot but I think through the whole process, I'm more open to 'alternative' solutions in general. It's the best example there is for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's right for most people isn't necessarily right for you, and guess what: Maybe what most people use isn't right for them in the first place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you have to have been on the 'other side' to recognize it. Still the best example: Imagine you're sitting on an island, nothing but a nice, completely wiped Lenovo business laptop, a windows 7 DVD, a Ubuntu Live CD and an Internet connection. You probably couldn't get the Internet working on windows because of lacking drivers. So it wouldn't work at all, by today's standards. Ubuntu would happily connect to the Internet &lt;strong&gt;during setup&lt;/strong&gt;. Boom.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
On unix systems, the OS reigns over all the drivers, unless you decide break the OS's reign manually. Having some random .exe or .ini or .whatnot file speaking to my hardware  without even &lt;strong&gt;asking&lt;/strong&gt; the OS just sounds ridiculous to me now. The same applies for programs. Every single bit related to a program on your hard drive has its counterpart in the package manager, the OS knows what's going on. With windows, it's one big hairy mess. Anarchic hippie programs, sitting anywhere on the hard drive, at no point connected to the OS but messing up the registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it, I probably went way out of my technological expertise with this one. But hey, point for unix there: You don't even have to understand it entirely in order to use it on an advanced level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be honest: Windows 7 is the first iteration that recognized my LAN controller correctly on first boot, but I bet there are configurations out there which aren't that lucky.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;Custom 404 Page&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was inspired by a pic &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/mike_FTW&quot;&gt;Mike Monteiro&lt;/a&gt; shared on twitter: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dribbble.com/404&quot;&gt;dribblle 404 page&lt;/a&gt;. I immediately wanted one of those! So I began, and some coding, texting and a flickr search on &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.creativecommons.org/#&quot;&gt;search.creativecommons.org&lt;/a&gt; later, there it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.timmschoof.com/notthe404pagesoyoucanseeitworks&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/error404.jpg&quot; width=&quot;655&quot; height=&quot;238&quot; alt=&quot;404errorpage&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Now, how to 'deploy' your 404 page in a way that overrides the ugly standard apache-or-whatever-you're-using-standard page?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git-hosted Jekyll

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally, if you're using Jekyll and host on github pages, just put a 404.html file in the root directory of your repository. &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;They say&lt;/a&gt; that's sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random host

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When your site's hosted with a more beefed up provider, you propably have access to a .htaccess file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/sitemanagement/custom404error.html&quot;&gt;Basically&lt;/a&gt;, you need to put a .htaccess file in your site's root directory,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put the line

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ErrorDocument 404 /nameofyourcustom404page.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;in it  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and of course: create the custom 404 page and upload it to your root directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosteurope

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My page's hosted with hosteurope. Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://querbeet-deluxe.com&quot;&gt;querbeet-deluxe.com&lt;/a&gt; and its wordpress with all its sql databeses will be abandoned, I don't really need all the feautures of the webpack I'm currently paying for. But I didn't get to make the switch to github pages or S3 or whatever may be out there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With hosteurope, there's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://faq.hosteurope.de/index.php?cpid=10942&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; for customizing your 404 page. I guess that's because they don't want to let you control the .htaccess file. Well, it works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>#ProjectEarlyBird</title>
      <link>http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/17/project-early-bird</link>
      <pubDate>May 17, 2011</pubDate>
      <guid>http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/17/project-early-bird</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I always went to bed very late. I often played computer games till 1:30 or 2:30 am and &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; went to bed before 1 am. I loved that. I was a school kid, so it worked most of the time. Since I became a student, my easy-going sleep cycle annoyed me more and more. I already had lost the day, felt behind when I got up at 9:30 pm&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ate breakfast. I kept being late mentally which put myself under pressure and just didn't feel good. I knew that I had to change that habit. Knowing that but not being able to do so frustrated me even more.  &lt;br/&gt;
But who cared? I was in good company. Keeping up late is the ultimate cool, that was a fact, I myself always was suspicious of people who went to bed before midnight. My love for coffee and it's caffeine were the best excuse one could think of to keep up late, be late in the morning and brag about crazy sleep hours. &lt;em&gt;Myself, 4 months ago:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't fall asleep one minute before 2 am, I tried!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you do. Just regularly get up at 6 am and see how you will love to go to bed at 11 pm, even earlier, or midnight, depending on your needs. We owe it to our brains to sleep, that's a fact. Time measurement only has been around for a few hundred years, that's another fact you may consider. We depended on dawn and dusk before. Just think about all these studies reporting of health problems caused by shift work.&lt;br/&gt;
We shouldn't let time measurement go, of course. But I think being aware that it's artificial is interesting and allows us to consider some changes to our sleep rhythm. Or care about sleep in the first place. It was when I first realized that I got a sleep mask, cause in cities like Hamburg it's never completely dark. I'll renew my piece on light pollution some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, luckily &lt;a href=&quot;http://notgeeklycorrect.com/2011/01/24/5am-wake-up-is-it-crazy-to-wake-up-early&quot;&gt;Nicolas Alpi's post&lt;/a&gt; on rising early got linked to me. It was exactly what my unhappiness with status quo needed to force me to take action.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;#ProjectEarlyBird&lt;/strong&gt; went live on February 1st 2011, just when I started work on my first term paper. There was some serious synergy going on, because social life is reduced to a minimum during such workload. So, there was no distraction from&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting up at &lt;strong&gt;6 am&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(sometimes) running some 5 kilometers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having breakfast/reading feeds/checking twitter/&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having some free time/cleaning/dishes/collecting 'next steps' for the term paper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arriving at the bibliotheca at about &lt;strong&gt;10 am&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having dinner at about &lt;strong&gt;12:30 pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuing to work at about &lt;strong&gt;1:30 pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;going home at about &lt;strong&gt;6 pm&lt;/strong&gt; and feeling awkwardly good about it&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;going shopping/cooking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watching a film or some episodes of a tv series and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; feeling guilty about it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;going to bed at about &lt;strong&gt;10:00 pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think that's a good example if how I did it in the first weeks. Of course work doesn't get done by itself,&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; but getting up early gives you the best starting position there can possibly be. I sticked with 6 am, though the really hard part was to not letting go of the whole project when both of my term papers were finished and the new semester began. Sadly, I let go of the running part, so as you can see, rising early makes you no super human.&lt;br/&gt;
Want to try it? I started by moving the wake up time earlier in steps of half an hour per week from current wake up time - till my iPhone went crazy smashing 'Eye of the Tiger' every morning at 6 am. Even on the weekends, of course. In general, I followed Nicolas' advise, his article's really great. Also interesting: &lt;a href=&quot;http://zenhabits.net/10-benefits-of-rising-early-and-how-to-do-it/&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt; by Leo Babauta. Kudos to Shawn Blanc for &lt;a href=&quot;http://shawnblanc.net/2011/01/rising-early/&quot;&gt;linking&lt;/a&gt; to both articles I referred to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So, why 6 am?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided that 6 am works better for me than 4:30 or 5 am would. Just too often there's an event or something else that doesn't let me go to bed as early as I should, so 6 am is a good compromise between my needs and the social calendar. Though, I'm tempted to try 5:30 am. I began #ProjectEarlyBird in the Winter, so at first it was dark and cold outside at 6 pm. Currently, the sun dawns at about 5 am, and makes it even easier to get up that early.&lt;br/&gt;
I also love about it that it takes more effort to make room for a night out. I had the tendency to always stretch that 'one beer' out very late and often was blaming myself for it the next day. Now I have to alter my sleep cycle very much for drinking some beers with friends, therefore plan very carefully for lesser, but more special occasions.&lt;br/&gt;
I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; rising early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When there was no lecture at 10:00 am which I attended, that was an early one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I just as much as never managed to eat breakfast at home before I left for the day. I didn't have appetite in the morning, but my stomach hurt a little. Vicious circle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really started to get hungry at about noon, exceptionally early for me!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of punishing myself for being late in the morning by keeping up late in the evening, despite being tired and the loss of focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At first, it really feels like it does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Almost one year till the Nazis from the Moon invade the Earth, quite some time. Haven't heard of it yet? Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ironsky.net/site/&quot;&gt;ironsky.net&lt;/a&gt;. You really get the feeling this films' indie-crew from finland means business.&lt;br/&gt;
I like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vimeo.com/13822305&quot;&gt;second teaser&lt;/a&gt; a bit better, though.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Summer</title>
      <link>http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/12/Summer</link>
      <pubDate>May 12, 2011</pubDate>
      <guid>http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/12/Summer</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Really? A blogpost in which I praise Hamburg, spring/summer&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and my life in between?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, there's nothing more trivial than the weather. But on the other hand, there's nothing more elementary. I first realized it some time ago, when there were a few days that felt like summer, but it wasn't quite there yet. Going by bike to school/work/university is awesome, even in the winter. But in the summer, it really is off the chart. It's a vivid feeling of freedom and flexibility, I feel in touch with the city and people who live here, I just get into a good mood.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Just great, I love it. There's the beach at the Elbe, there's all the nice places around the Alster. I love days that consist of having a barbecue, having good conversations, drinking some beers and eating delicious, tasty meat.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;s&gt;And the cherry on top of the awesomeness which is my life&lt;/s&gt; Here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; I just wrote this, sitting in the sun in front of the lecture hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So: Yes indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For me, there are just two seasons, winter and summer of course&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get a kick out of it, I can't understand how people come to use public transportation all the time when there's &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; way to go by bike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quoting Barney Stinson here&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Three</title>
      <link>http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/12/Three</link>
      <pubDate>May 12, 2011</pubDate>
      <guid>http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/12/Three</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The RSS feed&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; should work properly now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I placed the Google Analytics code snippet in my header, so now this blog's evil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I skipped one lecture today because of an error I couldn't stand one second longer than necessary. Lets just say: Don't give your #body div the attribute height: auto.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; And when testing, clear your browser cache before pushing the changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you can see, I'm using footnotes now. Wouldn't have thought of it by myself, but many other Jekyll blogs have them, and I saw and liked it. Keeps me from having to write all my weird thoughts in brackets, where they distract you more than necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three? Are you going to name all your posts like some Led Zeppelin wanna-be rockband's albums?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  No. It's not a bug&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, it's a feature. You may have noticed that there's no 'About this Blog' in the navigation on the right. I intend to add such a page and then link to all the numbered posts on it. Then, every time I change or add something, I'll add a new numbered post. The result: This blog's real history instead of a static page that never is up to date or just reflects the current state. If you as a visitor want to know who I am, there already is the 'About' link to my Personal Page. That's my plan for now, if I change it, guess what kind of title the post will have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;(Where are the) Comments?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one's too big for a list entry. As you may have realized, currently there are no comments on this blog. Two things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't get to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't know if I want to, not yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A jekyll-based blog doesn't have a database, so comments don't work out of the box. But there's the cloud and in it there's &lt;a href=&quot;http://disqus.com/&quot;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;, so that's no problem.&lt;br/&gt;
Regarding the want-part: I think a blog should fuel collaboration, communication, comments, and feedback. But it can do so without comments directly under every post. There's no lack of channels for discussion nowadays, even without them. The lack of comments is likely to encourage people to start their own blog and write about their opinion, or at least send you a tweet or an email, one might say. Oh, how I'd want this to be true.&lt;br/&gt;
I think that without comments, people really are more likely to do one of the mentioned things. But the &lt;em&gt;overall&lt;/em&gt; barrier to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; as a reaction to what they just read is much higher without comments. And I'd like some feedback. For me, that's what the whole pro/con comments discussion boils down to. At least if you like participation and feedback as I do. All of that, of course, depends on who your audience is and to which extent you have a 'my blog, my space' picture in mind&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't decided yet. For now, maybe I'll add a 'Contact' link to the navigation, so when someone reads a blogpost and wants to insult me there's a list of all the channels one click away, without the detour by the Personal Page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and how could I close on this article without mentioning Iven's &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivenwinkelmann.com/journal/my-take-on-baked-blogs/&quot;&gt;take on it&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What the &lt;strong&gt;heck&lt;/strong&gt; is the difference between Atom and RSS? I mean, is there any difference at all when you're pushing an ordinary, non-multilingual feed that contains simple HTML?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least I think that's where I went wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read: my laziness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That sounds egocentric, but really isn't as it's not necessarily opposed to the attitude that feedback's good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Two</title>
      <link>http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/11/Two</link>
      <pubDate>May 11, 2011</pubDate>
      <guid>http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/11/Two</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first thought about my new blog, the only options for me were: WordPress, Tumblr, maybe posterous. That was until &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivenwinkelmann.com/&quot;&gt;Iven&lt;/a&gt; told me about 'baked blogs'. What? - Yeah, that's what I thought, too.&lt;br/&gt;
Let me explain: In this analogy, the previously mentioned platforms 'fry' the blog in the second one requests them from the web server. They generate every page in the blog via PHP, I believe. Blogs served that way are 'fried blogs'.&lt;br/&gt;
Guess what: The server doesn't have to generate static files. So your blog has a fighting chance of staying online, even when it gets &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.23x.net/216/anatomy-of-a-fireballing.html&quot;&gt;fireballed&lt;/a&gt;.
Of course one can cache the fried files so they can be served more efficiently, and you lose the advantages of hosted platforms, i.e. blogging from on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why I went baked&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in which universe does that bother me? Most certainly, my blog will never get fireballed or sweat a tear under heavy load of hundreds of thousands of visitors. I'm not that into web server stuff that I could't bear with what some people may call an unsophisticated solution. So?&lt;br/&gt;
What made me consider a baked blog more seriously was that with wordpress, I always had the feeling to utilize something I didn't understand entirely. Using wordpress is simple, but to customize it is much harder. Therefore it's likely you just use it in a very standard way. That's ok for most people, I would suggest that for nearly everyone who's inclined to dive into the world of blogging. Which I strongly suggest, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, for my part, &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; that I would be able to teach myself (or: remind) enough HTML and CSS to code something suitable for a static file generator (that's how you call the things that bake your blog). I knew that the second I heard of baked blogs, even thought I didn't realize it immediately.&lt;br/&gt;
Now, my blog only contains code I wrote myself or ripped off somebody else's git repository, knowing what it does and where to put it. To me, that's &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jekyll&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I chose &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;? At first I didn't want to. After Iven &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivenwinkelmann.com/journal/my-take-on-baked-blogs/&quot;&gt;told me about baked blogs&lt;/a&gt;, I listened to an episode of Build &amp;amp; Analyze (&lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/18&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, but the following ones also fit the topic) in which Marco Arment (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instapaper.com/iphone&quot;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; guy) talked about his plans to release his self-written static site generator, 'Second Crack' on github. I also am a coffee nut, so its name (a specific point of time in the roasting process of coffee) made me want to use it. In the end, the idea that I was using this as an excuse to put the whole project off became a certainty, so I chose Jekyll, and here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be acurate: If you're interested in this topic, you propably want to read Brent Simmons' piece on it: &lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs&quot;&gt;A plea for baked weblogs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
