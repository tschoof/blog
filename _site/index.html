<h2 class="title"><a href="/2011/05/17/project-early-bird">#ProjectEarlyBird</a></h2>
<div id="post-date">17 May 2011</div>
<p>I always stood up late. I often played computer games till 1:30 or 2:30 am and <strong>never</strong> went to bed before 1 am. I loved that. I was a school kid, so it worked most of the time. Since I became a student, my easy-going sleep cycle annoyed me more and more. I already had lost the day, felt behind when I got up at 9:30 pm<sup>1</sup> and ate breakfast. I kept being late mentally which put myself under pressure and just didn't feel good. I knew that I had to change that habit. Knowing that but not being able to do so frustrated me even more.  <br/>
And: But who cared? I was in good company. Staying up late is the ultimate cool, that was a fact, I myself always was suspicious of people who went to bed before midnight. My love for coffee and it's caffeine were the best excuse one could think of to stay up late, be late in the morning and brag about crazy sleep hours. <em>Myself, 4 months ago:</em></p>

<blockquote><p>I couldn't fall asleep one minute before 2 am, I tried!</p></blockquote>

<p>Yeah, you do. Just regularly get up at 6 am and see how you will love to go to bed at 11 pm, even earlier, or midnight, depending on your needs. We owe it to our brains to sleep, that's a fact. Time measurement only has been around for a few hundred years, that's another fact you may consider. We depended on dawn and dusk before. Just think about all these studies reporting of health problems caused by shift work.<br/>
We shouldn't let time measurement go, of course. But I think being aware that it's artificial is interesting and allows us to consider some changes to our sleep rhythm. Or care about sleep in the first place. It was when I first realized that I got a sleep mask, cause in cities like Hamburg it's never completely dark. I'll renew my piece on light pollution some time.</p>

<p>Then, luckily <a href="http://notgeeklycorrect.com/2011/01/24/5am-wake-up-is-it-crazy-to-wake-up-early">Nicolas Alpi's post</a> on rising early got linked to me. It was exactly what my unhappiness with status quo needed to force me to take action.<br/>
 <strong>#ProjectEarlyBird</strong> went live on February 1st 2011, just when I started work on my first term paper. There was some serious synergy going on, because social life is reduced to a minimum during such workload. So, there was no distraction from</p>

<ul>
<li>getting up at <strong>6 am</strong></li>
<li>(sometimes) running some 5 kilometers</li>
<li>having breakfast/reading feeds/checking twitter/<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>having some free time/cleaning/dishes/collecting 'next steps' for the term paper</li>
<li>arriving at the bibliotheca at about <strong>10 am</strong></li>
<li>having dinner at about <strong>12:30 pm</strong><sup>3</sup></li>
<li>continuing to work at about <strong>1:30 pm</strong></li>
<li>going home at about <strong>6 pm</strong> and feeling awkwardly good about it<sup>4</sup></li>
<li>going shopping/cooking</li>
<li>watching a film or some episodes of a tv series and <em>not</em> feeling guilty about it</li>
<li>going to bed at about <strong>10:00 pm</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>I think that's a good example if how I did it in the first weeks. Of course work doesn't get done by itself,<sup>5</sup> but getting up early gives you the best starting position there can possibly be. I sticked with 6 am, though the really hard part was to not letting go of the whole project when both of my term papers were finished and the new semester began. Sadly, I let go of the running part, so as you can see, rising early makes you no super human.<br/>
Want to try it? I started by moving the wake up time earlier in steps of half an hour per week from current wake up time - till my iPhone went crazy smashing 'Eye of the Tiger' every morning at 6 am. Even on the weekends, of course. In general, I followed Nicolas' advise, his article's really great. Also interesting: <a href="http://zenhabits.net/10-benefits-of-rising-early-and-how-to-do-it/">this piece</a> by Leo Babauta. Kudos to Shawn Blanc for <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2011/01/rising-early/">linking</a> to both articles I referred to.</p>

<h3>So, why 6 am?</h3>

<p>I decided that 6 am works better for me than 4:30 or 5 am would. Just too often there's an event or something else that doesn't let me go to bed as early as I should, so 6 am is a good compromise between my needs and the social calendar. Though, I'm tempted to try 5:30 am. I began #ProjectEarlyBird in the Winter, so at first it was dark and cold outside at 6 pm. Currently, the sun dawns at about 5 am, and makes it even easier to get up that early.<br/>
I also love about it that it takes more effort to make room for a night out. I had the tendency to always stretch that 'one beer' out very late and often was blaming myself for it the next day. Now I have to alter my sleep cycle very much for drinking some beers with friends, therefore plan very carefully for lesser, but more special occasions.<br/>
I <strong>love</strong> rising early.</p>

<ol>
<li>When there was no lecture at 10:00 am which I attended, that was an early one.</li>
<li>I just as much as never managed to eat breakfast at home before I left for the day. I didn't have appetite in the morning, but my stomach hurt a little. Vicious circle.</li>
<li>I really started to get hungry at about noon, exceptionally early for me!</li>
<li>Instead of punishing myself for being late in the morning by staying late in the evening, despite being tired and the loss of focus</li>
<li>At first, it really feels like it does</li>

I like the <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/13822305">second teaser</a> a bit better, though.</p>

<h2 class="title"><a href="/2011/05/12/Summer">Summer</a></h2>
<div id="post-date">12 May 2011</div>
<p>Really? A blogpost in which I praise Hamburg, spring/summer<sup>1</sup> and my life in between?</p>

<p>On one hand, there's nothing more trivial than the weather. But on the other hand, there's nothing more elementary. I first realized it some time ago, when there were a few days that felt like summer, but it wasn't quite there yet. Going by bike to school/work/university is awesome, even in the winter. But in the summer, it really is off the chart. It's a vivid feeling of freedom and flexibility, I feel in touch with the city and people who live here, I just get into a good mood.<sup>2</sup> Just great, I love it. There's the beach at the Elbe, there's all the nice places around the Alster. I love days that consist of having a barbecue, having good conversations, drinking some beers and eating delicious, tasty meat.<br/>
<s>And the cherry on top of the awesomeness which is my life</s> Here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life:<sup>3</sup> I just wrote this, sitting in the sun in front of the lecture hall.</p>

<p>So: Yes indeed.</p>

<hr />

<ol>
<li>For me, there are just two seasons, winter and summer of course</li>
<li>I <em>really</em> get a kick out of it, I can't understand how people come to use public transportation all the time when there's <em>any</em> way to go by bike</li>

<h2 class="title"><a href="/2011/05/12/Three">Three</a></h2>
<div id="post-date">12 May 2011</div>
<ul>
<li>The RSS feed<sup>1</sup> should work properly now.</li>
<li>I placed the Google Analytics code snippet in my header, so now this blog's evil.</li>
<li>I skipped one lecture today because of an error I couldn't stand one second longer than necessary. Lets just say: Don't give your #body div the attribute height: auto.<sup>2</sup> And when testing, clear your browser cache before pushing the changes.</li>
<li>As you can see, I'm using footnotes now. Wouldn't have thought of it by myself, but many other Jekyll blogs have them, and I saw and liked it. Keeps me from having to write all my weird thoughts in brackets, where they distract you more than necessary.</li>
<li><em>'Three? Are you going to name all your posts like some Led Zeppelin wanna-be rockband's albums?'</em><br/>
No. It's not a bug<sup>3</sup>, it's a feature. You may have noticed that there's no 'About this Blog' in the navigation on the right. I intend to add such a page and then link to all the numbered posts on it. Then, every time I change or add something, I'll add a new numbered post. The result: This blog's real history instead of a static page that never is up to date or just reflects the current state. If you as a visitor want to know who I am, there already is the 'About' link to my Personal Page. That's my plan for now, if I change it, guess what kind of title the post will have.</li>
</ul>


<h3>(Where are the) Comments?</h3>

<p>This one's too big for a list entry. As you may have realized, currently there are no comments on this blog. Two things.</p>

<ul>
<li>I didn't get to it.</li>
<li>I don't know if I want to, not yet.</li>
</ul>


<p>A jekyll-based blog doesn't have a database, so comments don't work out of the box. But there's the cloud and in it there's <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, so that's no problem.<br/>
Regarding the want-part: I think a blog should fuel collaboration, communication, comments, and feedback. But it can do so without comments directly under every post. There's no lack of channels for discussion nowadays, even without them. The lack of comments is likely to encourage people to start their own blog and write about their opinion, or at least send you a tweet or an email, one might say. Oh, how I'd want this to be true.<br/>
I think that without comments, people really are more likely to do one of the mentioned things. But the <em>overall</em> barrier to do <em>anything</em> as a reaction to what they just read is much higher without comments. And I'd like some feedback. For me, that's what the whole pro/con comments discussion boils down to. At least if you like participation and feedback as I do. All of that, of course, depends on who your audience is and to which extent you have a 'my blog, my space' picture in mind<sup>4</sup>.</p>

<p>I haven't decided yet. For now, maybe I'll add a 'Contact' link to the navigation, so when someone reads a blogpost and wants to insult me there's a list of all the channels one click away, without the detour by the Personal Page.</p>

<p>Oh, and how could I close on this article without mentioning Iven's <a href="http://ivenwinkelmann.com/journal/my-take-on-baked-blogs/">take on it</a>?</p>

<hr />

<ol>
<li>What the <strong>heck</strong> is the difference between Atom and RSS? I mean, is there any difference at all when you're pushing an ordinary, non-multilingual feed that contains simple HTML?</li>
<li>At least I think that's where I went wrong.</li>
<li>read: my laziness</li>
<li>That sounds egocentric, but really isn't as it's not necessarily opposed to the attitude that feedback's good.</li>

<h2 class="title"><a href="/2011/05/11/Two">Two</a></h2>
<div id="post-date">11 May 2011</div>
<p>When I first thought about my new blog, the only options for me were: WordPress, Tumblr, maybe posterous. That was until <a href="http://ivenwinkelmann.com/">Iven</a> told me about 'baked blogs'. What? - Yeah, that's what I thought, too.<br/>
Let me explain: In this analogy, the previously mentioned platforms 'fry' the blog in the second one requests them from the web server. They generate every page in the blog via PHP, I believe. Blogs served that way are 'fried blogs'.<br/>
Guess what: The server doesn't have to generate static files. So your blog has a fighting chance of staying online, even when it gets <a href="http://blog.23x.net/216/anatomy-of-a-fireballing.html">fireballed</a>.
Of course one can cache the fried files so they can be served more efficiently, and you lose the advantages of hosted platforms, i.e. blogging from on the road.</p>

<h3>Why I went baked</h3>

<p>But in which universe does that bother me? Most certainly, my blog will never get fireballed or sweat a tear under heavy load of hundreds of thousands of visitors. I'm not that into web server stuff that I could't bear with what some people may call an unsophisticated solution. So?<br/>
What made me consider a baked blog more seriously was that with wordpress, I always had the feeling to utilize something I didn't understand entirely. Using wordpress is simple, but to customize it is much harder. Therefore it's likely you just use it in a very standard way. That's ok for most people, I would suggest that for nearly everyone who's inclined to dive into the world of blogging. Which I strongly suggest, too.</p>

<p>I, for my part, <em>knew</em> that I would be able to teach myself (or: remind) enough HTML and CSS to code something suitable for a static file generator (that's how you call the things that bake your blog). I knew that the second I heard of baked blogs, even thought I didn't realize it immediately.<br/>
Now, my blog only contains code I wrote myself or ripped off somebody else's git repository, knowing what it does and where to put it. To me, that's <strong>very</strong> appealing.</p>

<h3>Jekyll</h3>

<p>Why did I chose <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>? At first I didn't want to. After Iven <a href="http://ivenwinkelmann.com/journal/my-take-on-baked-blogs/">told me about baked blogs</a>, I listened to an episode of Build &amp; Analyze (<a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/18">this one</a>, but the following ones also fit the topic) in which Marco Arment (the <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/iphone">Instapaper</a> guy) talked about his plans to release his self-written static site generator, 'Second Crack' on github. I also am a coffee nut, so its name (a specific point of time in the roasting process of coffee) made me want to use it. In the end, the idea that I was using this as an excuse to put the whole project off became a certainty, so I chose Jekyll, and here I am.</p>

<p>To be acurate: If you're interested in this topic, you propably want to read Brent Simmons' piece on it: <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs">A plea for baked weblogs</a></p>

<h2 class="title"><a href="/2011/05/10/one">One</a></h2>
<div id="post-date">10 May 2011</div>
<p>Finally, it's here. My new blog. Self-hosted, home-baked, 100% hand-crafted. A bunch of HTML files, one CSS file, a header, a favicon, a jekyll-installation, one 'jekyll --server' command, an upload to my FTP server (my deployment method so far), that's it.<br/>
<strong>OMG</strong>, I can't believe how long I put this off, this progress that took me about two days of 'coding', if my method of c&amp;p combined with trial&amp;error qualifies as such. It's funny: You might think I'm fishing for compliments here, but that's just the case if you're worse than me when it comes to HTML and such. If you're not, then you're probably laughing at my style.css' structure right now.</p>

<p>Anyway: I'm proud like Tom Hanks in 'Cast Away', when he finally managed to start a fire. Me can haz blog! But most important: I no longer can keep myself from writing by thinking that in order to do so, I would first need to build a new blog cause the last project's dead.</p>

<h3>future</h3>

<p>I will talk about little aspects, decisions and stuff that yet has to be done regarding this blog. As you may know, in the first few days of such a project nothing is just 'done', everything gets a pretty short half-life. Therefore I will comment the further construction of this site as it happens.<br/>
So I'll handle it just like Iven announced on <a href="http://ivenwinkelmann.com/journal">his blog</a>, a quite similar project. Similar does not quite describe it, to tell the truth: I have to thank Iven, without him doing a lot of research and waving in front of my nose with sophisticated solutions, I wouldn't have developed the urge to build a non-wordpress-hosted blog from scratch.<br/>
Thanks, buddy. (Is 'mindfork' a word? This github stuff messes with my head)</p>
