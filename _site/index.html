<h2 class="title"><a href="/2011/06/25/gmail-finally-got-awesome-on-ios">gmail finally got awesome on iOS</a></h2>
<div id="post-date">25 Jun 2011</div>
<p>Since January, the native iOS app respects your settings in gmail regarding the 'Send Mail as' email address. That's exactly what I waited for. gmail is a great, if not <strong>the</strong> tool for managing multiple email accounts. In these days of information, email overflow and 'just create an account' for me, that's crucial. But there are/were some drawbacks with gmail.</p>

<p>Since I live in Germany, my account mail ends with '@googlemail.com' instead of '@gmail.com', due to some ridiculous legal restrictions (another company named gmail wanted to make some money). Back in 1800, when I created that google account, the term 'proxy' wasn't familiar to me, so now I have to live with the unnecessarily long domain. But that's not Google's fault.<br/>
I mentioned multiple accounts. gmail is the workhorse that does all your mail labeling, sorting, filtering, deleting, forwarding etc. But until January, you couldn't hide the fact that you're using gmail when you were using an iOS device. Mail on iOS would send every email from your gmail address, and not from the 'Send Mail as' you set in the gmail web app. This would've led to an inconsistency when you were mostly using some personal mail address with a nice domain for example, but mails from your iPhone would come from a different address.<br/>
My contacts would end up with the beautiful mail address I put on my card, maybe send me emails to it, and then, one day, get email from a different 'Timm Schoof' who's not in their contacts. 'Did you change your email address?' - '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oqgnKgwDsk&amp;feature=youtube_gdta_player">Yeah, no, yeah no, you know...</a>'<br/>
I can't have that, I'm not a geek to have <strong>that</strong> conversation. It just wasn't a sophisticated or acceptable solution, considering all the effort I made configuring gmail for being my all-email-backend.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, Google has solved that problem. Mail on iOS now sends emails from the email address you set in the 'normal' gmail web app. Unfortunately, Google <a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138740&amp;topic=14252">buries</a> the information how to get there deep I their support pages.<br/>
You need to go to <a href="http://m.google.com/sync">m.google.com/sync</a> on your iDevice (that's where you can enable multiple calendars to sync with Google, too). Now, it gets messy. If you're accessing that site from outside the US or UK, as I was, it tells you: <em>Google Sync wird auf ihrem Gerät nicht unterstützt</em>, German for: <em>Google Sync isn't available on your device</em>. Bummer. The key lies within <em>Sprache ändern</em>, <em>Change language</em>. Switch to English and you're good to go. On the next page, you can access your Google Sync enabled devices and check <em>Enable 'Send Mail as' for this device</em>, hit save and live in peace.<br/>
Of course, you have to <a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138740&amp;topic=14252">set up Google Sync with your iDevice</a> i.e. Exchange Server, to use gmail like this. I strongly recommend this way of using it over IMAP or POP3 with some other host, and most likely even over the upcoming iCloud stuff. Cheers.</p>

<div id="post-date">24 Jun 2011</div>
<p>I had no idea! I was sabotaging my minimalistic approach towards this blog entirely by using the Ubuntu font all wrong.<br/>
I implemented it via @font-face and had <strong>nothing</strong> but problems with getting f#ing Firefox to display it correctly. Yesterday, I spent several hours and finally got it fixed. The joy didn't las long: Since December of 2010, the Ubuntu font is available via the Google Font API, and I just discovered today that's a good thing. What did I do all the time instead of <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Ubuntu&amp;subset=latin#code">using it</a>? Let my visitors load some nice 1,5mb of font data. Yay.<br/>
Loading a font equals loading a font you might think: <em>Google has to load it too, stupid!</em> -  Wrong. Well, yes but: I don't know whether github (where I'm hosted) slowed it all down, being free and and offering correspondent performance, but sure is: Now, with the Google Font API, this site loads amazingly fast.</p>

<p>Literally, one new line of code and 3 or 4 adjustments in my stylesheet was all it took. The latter solely due to my poor CSS skills and huge amount of <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/15">technological debt</a> I created. In case this is news to you - Everything necessary is to find here: <a href="http://font.ubuntu.com/web/">font.ubuntu.com/web</a>.</p>

<h2 class="title"><a href="/2011/06/23/Game-of-Thrones">Game of Thrones</a></h2>
<div id="post-date">23 Jun 2011</div>
<p><em>This post is intended to be spoiler-free till the last paragraph</em><br/>
Damn, what a great first season. Basically, medieval times aren't my favorite genre, but this world is more vivid than some of the worlds pictured in series with modern setting. I'm glad I began to watch '<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/">Game of Thrones</a>' when the 9th episode was already about to air, I don't know how psyched I would've got if I would've had to wait a whole week in between the single episodes.</p>

<p>Sometimes I thought I had recognized a change of scene and anticipated the next, but the current would continue and last almost twice as long as your average scene in films or other TV Series. To recognize how conditioned we are in these matters, I found quite shocking. However, the long lasting scenes and dialogues result in serious storytelling<sup>1</sup> and deeply drawn characters. They die like flies, but you get to know them very well beforehand. 'GoT' isn't called 'The Sopranos with swords' for nothing.<br/>
For not falling behind on whose sister sent a raven about whose murder to whose sister's husband, check out <a href="http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/#!/guide/houses/">HBO's Viewer's Guide</a>, it keeps you from googling and finding yourself on a wiki(pedia) page full of potential spoilers.</p>

<p>This series' dialogues are a joy to listen to, and they have a certain self-awareness to them. I also really like their humor. In one scene, King Robert Baratheon and his despised wife, Queen Cersei Lannister ask themselves what it was that held together the Kingdoms all these years. '<em>Our marriage?</em>' he asks. Silence.<br/>
In other TV Series, this would've been a moment of weakness, in which the wannabe-sentimental  moment had been cheaply exploited for a kiss, so the masses could relax in their chairs and join the characters in their fake world, dreaming of theirs to be that simple. No, 'Game of Thrones' doesn't do that. After Robert asks the question, he and his wife burst out laughing and quickly settle on their hate to having held it all together. I almost applauded, but I couldn't, I clenched my fists in silent expression of gratitude to the writers and producers who didn't go down that road.</p>

<p>I also like the violence in this series. It's not omnipresent, but when it's there, it's raw, bloody, sometimes quite unexpected<sup>2</sup> and most of the time totally approved by everyone, even by the casualties-to-be. And you say our society is depraved about this.</p>

<p>What about the rest? Some supernatural content and magic is beautifully justified with the world of 'Game of Thrones' being another universe than ours, adding other nice touches like seasons lasting for several years. Huge fan, out of pure longig for this fantasy world I already bought the first of the books<sup>3</sup> the series is based on. Maybe this one gets me to read novels again.<br/>
Can't wait for the second season. I just <strong><em>attention, spoiling 9th episode</em></strong> wonder if they casted Sean Bean solely as 'cart horse' for the first season. Otherwise I can't figure out why you'd slaughter the most popular actor of the cast, i.e. cast him for a (main) character who is decapitated in the first season, literally <em>by the book</em>. I'm not arguing his death, it's okay, <a href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/06/you-should-keep-watching-game-of-thrones/">GeekDad is absolutely right</a>: Letting the honest and honorable die makes the story, be it TV or novel, so good. Plus: In my opinion, Ned Stark was too whiny and naïve for King's Landing anyway. I mean, who has half his guard slaughtered more often?</p>

<p>Do watch this.</p>

<li>Medieval people seem to scheme like masterminds, unimaginable for my modern age, lazy brain.</li>
<li>Well, the unseathing of the swords gives you an idea. I'd like an instrument like this nowadays. Imagine you walking down the street, someone gets in your way. Instead of walking by, doing nothing, you unsheathe your sword. Depending on how sophisticated you pull it off, you got yourself a slave, get  offered a match with his daughter or lose your head in duel.</li>
<li>eBook, of course. Interesting: the English kindle edition is <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Game-Thrones-Song-Fire-ebook/dp/B000QCS8TW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A11MW6AJTK8WZ7&amp;s=digital-text&amp;qid=1308776721&amp;sr=1-2">5,67€</a>, but in Germany there's a fixed price for books (hooray), so even the German eBook is <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Das-Lied-von-Feuer-ebook/dp/B004OVEY4O/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A11MW6AJTK8WZ7&amp;s=digital-text&amp;qid=1308776721&amp;sr=1-5">9,99€</a>. Almost as twice as much. The German publishers really must hate progress.</li>

<h2 class="title"><a href="/2011/06/19/AirPlay-in-Totem">AirPlay in Totem</a></h2>
<div id="post-date">19 Jun 2011</div>
<p>A plug-in for Totem (Ubuntu's standard movie player), <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/01/airplay-video-playback-comes-to-totem/">released in January</a>, allows to stream video via Apple's AirPlay. I checked it out immediately, and it worked. With the release of Ubuntu 11.04, it stopped working. The plugin couldn't be activeated and Totem gave out the error message<br/>
<code>Unable to activate plugin AirPlay Support</code><br/>
Then, I found the solution, a comment on the very same article I linked to above. Like <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/pgkehle">Paul Kehle</a> says, once you install 'avahi-discover', it works. Run<br/>
<code>sudo apt-get install avahi-discover</code><br/>
in Terminal and you're fine. Thanks, Paul.<br/>
I just wanted to share this because I'd given up hope and just came across it by accident.</p>
