<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>I really do like feedback. Like I thought of in <a href="http://blog.timmschoof.com/2011/05/12/Three">this post</a>, I went from 'no comments' to <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> in October of 2011. Comment the hell out of it. Nonetheless, please feel free to:
<ul>
<li>give me a shout on <a href="http://twitter.com/tschoof">twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="mailto:hello@timmschoof.com">email</a> me</li>
<li>Start your own blog (if you don't already have one) at <a href="http://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a>, <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a> or <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> and use it to link to and comment on my posts. Afterwards, you can write posts yourself, but don't have to.</li>
<li>Create your own <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll-powered</a> blog and host it on github, like they do in <a href="http://blog.envylabs.com/2009/08/publishing-a-blog-with-github-pages-and-jekyll/">this tutorial</a>. It really isn't that hard. It's awesome.</li>
</ul>
</p>
