I completely agreed with [John Siracusa's CES-inspired article](http://hypercritical.co/2013/01/07/ces-worse-products-through-software) about how some hardware manufacturers don't care about software, what makes for severely worse products.

Completely unrelated and yet so akin, Bryan Jones, in [a very insightful piece on the evolution of smartphone cameras](http://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2012/12/the-iphone-as-camera-where-to-now/), mentions that camera manufacturers fall within that category. He even compares them to car manufacturers, Siracusa's go-to example for nearly everything: 

> The painful reality for many photographers is that Canon and Nikon make lousy software… They really do. I’m actually surprised that they, like the automotive industry, have been able to get away with poor software design for so long

I find it very interesting to see how different persons with different focuses, in a field as diverse as technology, incidentally come to the same conclusions.
