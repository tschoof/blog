My pal Timo and me are doing a podcast again! After a first attempt two years ago that lasted for an unbelievable amount of four episodes, we're not getting ahead of oursevles this time. However, the name stays the same: *ungeheuerlich eschoofierend*. Still in German, but we're not rambling about whatever comes to our minds anymore (at least not all the time). Instead, there's one big topic per episode. For now, we're on a 2-week-schedule.

Find our very nice site here: [ungeheuerlich.org](http://www.ungeheuerlich.org/) (Squarespace ftw!)

The [first episode](http://www.ungeheuerlich.org/episoden/1-craft-beer) was about Craft Beer, the next one will be about Religion.
