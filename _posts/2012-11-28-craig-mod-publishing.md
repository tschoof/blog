[Brilliant article](http://craigmod.com/journal/subcompact_publishing/) by [Craig Mod](https://alpha.app.net/craigmod) on (the future of) publishing. Interesting thoughts, well thought through, a joy to read. For me especially interesting regardin the [recent dying of German newspapers](http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/media-woes-hit-germany-as-financial-times-deutschland-goes-under-a-869001.html). 

Looking at [*The Magazine*](http://the-magazine.org)’, and even without that comparison, earlier Newsstand Apps like ‘Wired’ (and that's a good one, I would think) seem awfully bloated. Download of a few hundred MB every month, and a hm-okay-nice-but-too-complicated interface: Not the future. Craig points out why *The Magazine*'s approach has ‘disruption’ written all over it. Exciting.

When he talks about how there's no effortless way to pay writers, I [thought](https://alpha.app.net/tschoof/post/1738742) of [Flattr](http://flattr.com), this micropayment startup. I liked the idea from the beginning, and they're still there, but it doesn't really seem to take off. I would like it to, and I think every tech person would like it to take off, too. But I could never see my parents pay a writer that way. And that's where *feasible* and *effortless* come in. Like Craig puts it:

> [...] you’ll notice something magical about Newsstand: given the proper container, it’s a background downloading, offline-friendly, cached RSS machine people can subscribe to. *For money*. 

Boom.

Oh, [this interview with Brent Simmons](http://one37.net/blog/15/11/2012/real-life-with-brent-simmons), about writing and publishing also was recommended all over the internet yesterday. It strengthens Craig's point:

> But I no longer believe that the current set of publishers will embrace the future, whatever it is, and I believe they’ll be replaced by new publications.

I just came across even another interview: [Clayton Christensen on the news business](http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/10/clay-christensen-on-the-news-industry-we-didnt-quite-understand-how-quickly-things-fall-off-the-cliff/)
