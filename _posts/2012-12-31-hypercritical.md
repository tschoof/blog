So, that's it. ‘[Hypercritical](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical)’, one of my favourite podcasts, has had its run. Thanks a million to [John Siracusa](https://alpha.app.net/siracusa). And [Dan Benjamin](https://alpha.app.net/dan) for making John do the show in the first place.

**In** *almost* ***100*** episodes of awesomeness and epic rants, John Siracusa, the last real nerd out there, provided much insight on many, many topics around technology. I learned a ton about SSDs, programming languages, CPUs, the early days of Apple and much more. I had no idea of programming and many other topics, but through John's ability to explain stuff on an abstract level even enjoyed the very, very technical episodes. Just great.

A few of my favourite topics and may-be suggestions for you:

* [TiVo, Cable and TV in general](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/1) (The very first episode)
* [The Apple Stategy Tax](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/8)
* [Toaster Ovens ](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/18) (We Europeans don't have these, but interesting nevertheless)
* Walter Isaacson's Biography of Steve Jobs ([two](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/42) [episodes](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/43))
* File Systems ([two](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/56) [episodes](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/57))
* [App.net, and Tent.io as a decentralised protocol](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/88)
* [Voting Technology](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/93) (plus follow-up in the [episode after that](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/94))
