So, that's it. ‘[Hypercritical](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical)’, one of my favourite podcasts, has had its run. Thanks a million to [John Siracusa](https://alpha.app.net/siracusa), and [Dan Benjamin](https://alpha.app.net/dan) for making John do the show in the first place.

Almost 100 episodes of awesomeness and epic rants. John Siracusa, the last real nerd out there provided much insight on many, many topics around technology. I learned a ton about SSDs, programming, CPUs what have you: technology in general. I have no idea of programming, but enjoyed John's ability to explain stuff on an abstract level. Just great.

A few of my favourite topics and may-be suggestions for you:

* [TiVo, Cable and TV in general](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/1) (The very first episode)
* [The Apple Stategy Tax](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/8)
* [Toaster Ovens ](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/18) (We Europeans don't have these, but interesting nevertheless)
* Walter Isaacson's Biography of Steve Jobs ([two](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/42) [episodes](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/43))
* [File Systems](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/56) (Especially why HFS+ sucks and [what a file system needs in the age of SSDs](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/57))
* [App.net, and Tent.io as a decentralised protocol](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/88)
* [Voting Technology](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/93) (plus follow-up in the [episode after that](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/94))
