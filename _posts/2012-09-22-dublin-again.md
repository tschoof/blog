Just a few more photos. Dublin by day, mostly. A little St. Patrick's Cathedral, a little Merrion Square Park, even a little Trinity College again. Also: You should be able to get the idea of what 'quick weather changes' mean around here.

Don't wonder: Those iOS6 panorama shots of Dublin will come, for sure!
