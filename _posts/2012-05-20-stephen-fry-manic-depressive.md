I think this documentary is very interesting and fascinating.  
Example: It states that bipolar disorder is the most lethal mental illness, but most people suffering from it wouldn't choose to get rid of it. I also didn't know the first thing about Stephen Fry (my apologies), but he sure appears to be an interesting character.

Thx to [Iven](https://twitter.com/#!/ivenw) for pointing me at this documentary.
