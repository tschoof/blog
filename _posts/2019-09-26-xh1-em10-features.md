I just switched from an Olympus E-M10 to a Fuji X-H1. In so many ways, it's – unsurprisingly – such a joy to use a professional tool. While the E-M10 is/was a perfectly fine camera, technology has advanced, and entry-level cameras are just built differently than semi- or full on professional cameras.

But, by switching not only class of cameras but also manufacturers, I noticed there are differences that have nothing to do with the former. Which, sadly, means there are aspects in which the X-H1 is worse than an E-M10.



## Histogram/Highlight Warning
The live histogram is a great feature in most [DSLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorless_interchangeable-lens_camera), as is another one that's mostly just called "blinkies", which indicates which areas of the frame might have zero information in them because they're all black or bown out. Your DSLR might have blinkies as well, but by the very nature of a DSLR, you'd only see them on pictures in the back-LCD-review. Anyway, I'd call these features "exposure helps". 

And the X-H1 has them, of course. But – unsurprisingly now after the lead above – they're worse than on the E-M10. 

The histogram is rather small. A little more width really would help with judging how much exposure correction is needed to save which highlights. Plus: The image information doesn't go all the way to the edge of the grey background of the histogram graphic. It's very hard to see if there's already information lost without changing the exposure back and forth and staring at a tiny white line. It's a bad experience.

But: There's a "big histogram" option that is conveniently invoked by a shortcut. It shows RGB histograms as well as a "regular" one. I appreciate the better legibility. But... RGB? Come on. I know that *theoretically* the single color channels can blow out and therefore lose detail independently. But I have yet to encounter/think of a situation in which that information would be helpful. If you can explain to me how the RGB histograms make sense, I'd be happy to hear it!  
To make things even worse: The big histograms don't stay on the screen when the exposure is changed. That's not only bad, I'd call that unusable.

How does the E-M10 do it? The histogram is bigger, the information goes to the edge of the background and once there's information lost, the outer line turns orange – making it a vastly superior tool for judging the exposure.

### highlight warning

The highlight warnings on the X-H1 work exactly as they do on a Canon 40D, with the difference of being displayed live on the screen. Right off the bat, that's bad.  

Only clipped highlights are represented, lost shadow detail isn't. There's no reason for that.  

Furthermore, viewing a scene through the EVF and thining about all the aspects of photography is fundamentally different than chimping on the back of your camera and checking if the last few exposures were correct. A distracting blinking animation (blown out highlights alternate between black and white every half second) is tolerable during the latter, but it is a nuisance while framing a shot.

Let's look at the E-M10: First of all, Olympus considers lost shadow detail worthy of being brought to the photographer's attention. (Lost) shadow detail is displayed blue, lost highlight detail orange. And these colors don't blink, they are shown continuously.  
Personally, I find the color-ness of the "blinkies" much less distracting than the constant flashing, be it in black and white.

Thinking about this, I have to think about a manual focus help, focus peaking. For this function, Fuji offers a wide variety of colors – albeit no flash on/off variant. I'd appreciate a focus peaking-inspired overhaul of the highlight warning feature. 

## Auto ISO Display

With Auto ISO selected, the E-M10 always shows the ISO it'd chose right at that time. The X-H1 needs a half-press of the shutter as well as having exposure lock enabled for that action. Without that configuration, it just shows the maximum ISO of the defined Auto ISO range.

I don't know about you, but most of the time I'd like to know which ballpark I am in ISO-wise and don't need to know what the max Auto ISO is. The extra step with the exposure lock makes it even worse if you'd like the camera to measure exposure for every single frame of a burst.

But this really gets into how the cameras measure the scene. The behaviour of when the lens opens and closes the aperture for a) just supplying the evf with what it needs and b) focusing is completely different. The X-H1 stops down all the time, while the E-M10 only closes the aperture for actually taking the photo.  
Not gonna lie: The Olympus way feels more modern to me. Hearing the aperture unpredictably open and close is a little bit distracting. And I'd also think that an open aperture would just give the camera the most information for everything it needs to do. Except for focusing, where stopping down a bit would come with an advantage in accuracy I'd imagine. But Sony cameras also have the lens stop down in normal operation I think, so... there's that. 

In short: I'd really love some insight in what the fundamental difference in design of the whole (sensor/metering?) system is.
