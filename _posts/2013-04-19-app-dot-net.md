Granted, at first I thought that app.net was ‘just’ a Twitter clone. A Twitter clone though, that wouldn't one day crack down on third-party developers, regulate and limit access to their API like crazy, and try to make money by advertising. That is a long way of saying that I would've been completely okay with app.net being a Twitter that I pay for, but that also stays true to itself. And doesn't [shut out another service basically every other week](http://blog.flattr.net/2013/04/twitter-is-forcing-us-to-drop-users-ability-to-flattr-creators-by-favoriting-their-tweets/).

To be fair, that *is* what [join.app.net](https://join.app.net) says. But [Dalton Caldwell](https://alpha.app.net/dalton), head of app.net, [said they're working on that](https://alpha.app.net/tschoof/post/4637589). Because it is wrong. That only is a small part of what app.net is. 

I only learned when I listened to [*The New Disruptors* episode 13](http://www.muleradio.net/newdisruptors/13/), in which [Glenn Fleishman](https://alpha.app.net/glennf) interviews Dalton. And by that, I finally learned what ADN *really*is about.

I try to keep it as short as possible: App.net is a platform. They take money for offering APIs of all kinds. Alpha.app.net, the ‘Twitter clone’ was and is a proof of concept, nothing more, nothing less.  
Granted, most app.net-specific apps out there are clients for alpha.app.net. But there are also apps that use the storage you get with your app.net account and manage files on it, [Orbit](http://orbitapp.net/) and [Appchive](http://www.appchive.net/). Like [Droplr](http://www.droplr.com) or [Cloudapp](http://www.getcloudapp.com/), but on the webspace you have paid for. Feels good, and both apps are in an early, but promising stage. And there's more: 

* [Climber](https://directory.app.net/app/180/climber/), basically Vine for app.net, but also using *your* storage.
* [patter](https://directory.app.net/app/189/patter-for-ios/), a chat room thingy.  
* [Amy](https://directory.app.net/app/166/amy/), which puts app.net messaging in OS X Messages.app.  

As far as the *twitter-like* clients go: [Netbot](http://tapbots.com/software/netbot/), to be honest, is a bit boring by now. And tapbots have signalised that they aren't gonna implement a wide range of ADN features (*not every ADN feature*), like multiple recipients in direct messaging. 

[Felix](http://tigerbears.com/felix/) and [Riposte](http://riposteapp.net) are *very* interesting. Felix is a bit more ‘extreme’ in its ways, but also more fresh and innovative. Riposte is a bit more conservative, but goes definitely also in the right direction. Can't wait for a proper iPad version of Felix or Riposte, because Netbot currently is the only real option out there. That's it. I think I have an invite left, if you're interested. Oh, and my ADN nick is [@tschoof](https://alpha.app.net/tschoof), just as my [twitter](https://twitter.com/tschoof) one.
