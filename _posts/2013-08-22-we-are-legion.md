This is an interesting doucmentary. About the early and not-so-early days of Anonymous, Telecomix and LulzSec. It is partisan, for sure. But that also means it's not made by people who don't understand the Internet and therefore have no idea what they're talking about. 

Thanks to [Felix](http://felixkruse.de) for pointing me to it.
