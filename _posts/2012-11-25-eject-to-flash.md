One last note on the Flash-on-OS X-dance: If you keep Flash prisoner within Chrome (as you should) and normally use Safari, you might be interested in [Eject to Flash](http://www.relaxedapps.com/eject/). 

It opens Safari's current URL in Chrome and even gives you the option of closing that tab in Safari automatically. So, if everything else fails there's a more comfortable way to get to Flash-land than copy-pasting the URL and opening Chrome by hand. 

Quick Overview of the other posts on how to make avoiding Flash a breeze:

* Install the [YouTube5 Extension](http://blog.timmschoof.com/2012/07/15/html5-video-safari-os-x/) for Safari
* [Make Safari reload the current page with mobile Safari User Agent](http://blog.timmschoof.com/2012/07/15/html5-video-safari-os-x/)
