An independent filmmaker team put together an impressive SciFi Short with a Kickstarter budget. LEDs, projectors and models, shot in front of projected images of planets. I really like the retro SciFi style of [C 299,792 km/s](http://www.c-themovie.com) .

I recommend reading the [*Wired* piece](http://www.wired.com/design/2013/01/kickstarted-scifi-movie/) on it.

> At one point for the bridge scenes we had 4-5 projectors going all playing looped videos. For the planet shots we ended up projecting a video of Jupiter behind the ship that moved in sync with the camera to make it look like only the ship is moving. This created an interesting additional effect, since the texture of the screen still moved with the ship it gave a sort of haze to the planet which we liked.

And watching it, of course:

I loved the music, so I also [bought](http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/264241-shut-up-and-take-my-money) the [Soundtrack](http://c-themovie.bandcamp.com/album/c-soundtrack).
