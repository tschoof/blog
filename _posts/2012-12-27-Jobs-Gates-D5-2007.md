Very interesting to see this video nowadays. It was 2007, the iPhone had been announced. The iPad (early 2010) was only on the horizon, and Apple was – despite already having success with the iPod – nowhere near as big as today.  
All the ‘post-PC device’ talk and ‘great stuff coming’ had the iPad written all over it.<br><br>
