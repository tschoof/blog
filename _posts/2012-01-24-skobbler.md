[Skobbler for iOS](http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=skobbler%20ios%20app%20store%20german&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CDsQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fde%2Fapp%2Fgps-navigation-2-skobbler%2Fid329349116%3Fmt%3D8&ei=cPcbT9KlCNGa-wbGzNGuCg&usg=AFQjCNFiNQL2GzZB6yHQ8vQHZlbrBuj_bA) is a great example for the advantages that open source has to offer. It's a great navigation software, and at 1,59€, it costs almost nothing, especially when compared to Navigon (89,99€), TomTom (69,99€). The country you buy 'Skobbler' in is included, maps for other parts of europe or the world are a few euro.  
I uses the OpenStreetMap catalogue, so the quality may differ. But considering Skobbler's price, that's a risk one can take.  
I made two roadtrips with Skobbler, to Bremen and to Denmark. There were no errors. The audio commands just before you have to take a turn are very well timed 98% of the time. Those missing 2% are to be fixed, but I came across the same problem with a built-in BMW navigation system. Skobbler's great.
