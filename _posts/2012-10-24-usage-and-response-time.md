Anand Shimpi in his [epic iPhone 5 review](http://www.anandtech.com/show/6330/the-iphone-5-review/) *(highlights are mine)*: 

> **The reality is that with more performance comes increased device usage** - in other words, it's highly unlikely that with a 50% gain in performance users are simply going to continue to use their smartphone the same way as they would a slower device. Usage (and thus workload) doesn't remain constant, it's somewhat related to response time.

> Where things get complicated is if you use the faster CPU, GPU and network connectivity to increase your usage of the device. **In that case you could see no improvement or even a regression in battery life.**

This fact is easily forgotten when we talk about new devices and the expectations in battery life.
