With Eden Beta 3, XBMC introduced XBMCbuntu. It replaces the XBMC Live install, and basically is a 'buntu that boots into XBMC. It lets you tinker on system level using a GUI. So you no longer need to be a terminal freak to set up  wifi on your dedicated XBMC machine. Finally.  
I always chose Ubuntu or Lubuntu for such a machine, and then installed XBMC in the 'classic' way. But that method leaves it to you to let XBMC auto-start and so on. 

For pros, XBMCbuntu is not that much of a leap forward, but for wannabe unix nerds like me, it makes things easier (a lot).
