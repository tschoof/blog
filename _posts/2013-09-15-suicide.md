Suicide is fascinating to me. On the one hand, I feel like we should respect somebody's decision or assumption that, overall, they won't come out of their life "ahead". A line from an *Editors* song comes to mind:

> In the end all you can hope for // Is the love you felt to equal the pain you've gone through

I mean, who are you to tell somebody "No, no. You have to suffer at least 30 more years before I allow you to die"? 

On the other hand, it's not as simple as that. Suicide can't really be looked at isolated from depression or mental illness in general. I also ask myself if – aside from people who are terminally ill and don't want to suffer anymore – every person commiting suicide is by defintion mentally ill.  
Anyway, [this piece on the dramatic surge of suicides](http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2013/05/22/why-suicide-has-become-and-epidemic-and-what-we-can-do-to-help.html) is well worth a read:
