Almost one year till the Nazis from the Moon invade the Earth, quite some time. Haven't heard of it yet?

Check out [ironsky.net](http://www.ironsky.net/site/). You really get the feeling this films' indie-crew from finland means business.  
I like the [second teaser](http://www.vimeo.com/13822305) a bit better, though.
