I'm excited to finally share my new Podcast with you! [*Die Sonne über Altona*](http://sonnealtona.de/) is a weekly conversation with my friend [Alina](https://twitter.com/Oladi_Naht), about everything that's near and dear to our hearts. I'm afraid it's only for the German speakers out there. The first episode is about a very German topic as well: Traffic light signal transmitters (and their design flaws).
