I'm excited to finally share my new Podcast with you!  
[***Die Sonne über Altona***](http://sonnealtona.de/) is a weekly conversation with my friend [Alina](https://twitter.com/Oladi_Naht) about everything that's near and dear to our hearts. We talk (in German) about pop culture, politics & society, design, art and everything in between.

The first episode is about a very German topic as well: traffic lights signal transmitters (and of course: their design flaws). It's pretty good.

We're having so much fun doing this project, and would love for you to give us a chance in your weekly podcast rotation! Thanks.

Special thanks to [Maggy](http://www.margaretelaue.de/), who came up with our beautiful logo!

Getting into podcasts is hard, [as we all know](http://blog.timmschoof.com/2015/02/15/what-it-takes-to-listen-to-a-podcast/), so I'd appreciate any help in spreading the word. These are all the places for sharing and liking and following:
