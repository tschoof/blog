Apple's Home Sharing enables you to share all the content aggregated within the iTunes on one PC. It's like... well, exactly like iTunes Match for your wifi. You really don't need it once you use iTunes Match. Or do you?!

Yes. Unfortunately, Apple couldn't get all the German TV Show people on board with adding Movies and Shows to iTunes Match. Or whatever reason there is. Hence, a German and an US-Apple TV differ from one another.

As I mentioned above, there's 'Home Sharing' to help German Apple TV customers out. They can watch TV Shows they bought via iTunes just like they did pre-iOS 5.1. But as of now just in theory, because [Home Sharing doesn't work since iOS 5.1 and iTunes 10.6](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3788964#17834553). I just wanted to sketch out the current situation.
