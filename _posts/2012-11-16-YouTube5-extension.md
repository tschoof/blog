If you're on a Mac and use Safari, there's this problem with Flash. [Flash is dead](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/perlow/exclusive-adobe-ceases-development-on-mobile-browser-flash-refocuses-efforts-on-html5-updated/19226), but some people haven't realised yet, so it's still quite widespread on the web. And that has an annoying influence on the experience of people who want to go non-Flash on the web (but I still recommend doing so, especially on a Mac). 

Oh, funny page: [isflashdeadyet.com](http://isflashdeadyet.com).  
However, the absolutely amazing [**YouTube5 extension**](http://www.verticalforest.com/youtube5-extension/) makes it all better. It makes YouTube and Vimeo videos play in HTML5, as far as possible. In a way more beautiful player, way smoother, less stressful for your CPU. Gotta love this.  
In some cases, however, the [method of changing the Safari User Agent to 'iPad'](https://blog.timmschoof.com/2012/07/15/html5-video-safari-os-x/) may still help.
