Hello there!

Today, I fixed the [RSS Feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/timmschoof), so you can subscribe again without messing up your RSS reader. I'm sorry for the inconvenience, a nasty (and, on my part: dumb) syntax error tore it apart. I also changed the blog post's permalinks  and tweaked the metadata below the post titles a little. <s>Now the date doesn't mess up the nice *url.com/post_title* scheme anymore.</s> Now it does again, I like it better. This way, you have an idea how old a post is by just hovering the link, even if it's somewhere else on the web. And blogposts and pages are distinguable by the link, also.

There's more to come (content-wise too, for a change), so stay tuned.
