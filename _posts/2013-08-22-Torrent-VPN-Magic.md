I built something! Eh, coded. Well, applescript more feels like telling a story than coding, to be honest. Anyway, it's all on [GitHub](https://github.com/tschoof/VPN-Torrent-Magic). Short version: It makes sure that you don't torrent all those Ubuntu images while your super secure VPN is disconnected by accident. wink wink.

I'd love to give credit to people from whose posts in different places I copied snippets of the code I ended up using, but that'd take me another 5 hours. So thank you, Internet.
