* [Stay](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371257/)
	* I did like it. But it's still just 'psycho stuff'
	* Can there be movies like this after *Fight Club* that don't leave you feeling cheated on after watching?
* [Rabbit Hole](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0935075/)
	* Interesting. **Well** played. Can see where those Oscar Nominations came from
	* Really, one scene was the most intensive one I've watched in a long time. 
* [Enemy of the State](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120660/)
	* Yeah, it's just a Bruckheimer movie after all.
	* Will Smith wears a long, dark coat in one scene. He **so** [could've been Neo](http://www.toptenz.net/10-actors-who-passed-on-movie-roles.php).
	* How weird is that last scene? Gene Hackman films his lower legs on the beach and writes*"Wish you were here"* in the sand?
	* The [latest NSA reports](http://www.wired.com/search?query=NSA&cx=010858178366868418930%3Afk33zkiunj8&cof=FORID%3A9&ie=UTF-8) in mind, it's clear the agency's capabilities shown in the movie aren't overstated.
* [Forgetting Sarah Marshall](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800039/)
	* Better than I expected, but still not what you call a 'good movie'. Jason Segel isn't that good of an actor, but apparently he can write okay. 
* [Garden State](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333766/)
	* Same as *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, but better. Not so... 'blonde'?
	* Felt like a Road Movie to me. A fun journey, but I didn't know what to make of it at the end. Still better than your average chick flick, though.
* [Carnage](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1692486/)
	* I laughed hard the first time twelve minutes into the film. Christoph Waltz eating pie - hilarious. 
	* The film definitely has good scenes, and is what I consider 'a good film', but it  didn't fascinate, astonish or inspire me, if you catch my drift.
