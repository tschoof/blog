Really? A blogpost in which I praise Hamburg, spring/summer<sup>1</sup> and my life in between? 

On one hand, there's nothing more trivial than the weather. But on the other hand, there's nothing more elementary. I first realized it some time ago, when there were a few days that felt like summer, but it wasn't quite there yet. Going by bike to school/work/university is awesome, even in the winter. But in the summer, it really is off the chart. It's a vivid feeling of freedom and flexibility, I feel in touch with the city and people who live here, I just get into a good mood.<sup>2</sup> Just great, I love it. There's the beach at the Elbe, there's all the nice places around the Alster. I love days that consist of having a barbecue, having good conversations, drinking some beers and eating delicious, tasty meat.  
<s>And the cherry on top of the awesomeness which is my life</s> Here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life:<sup>3</sup> I just wrote this, sitting in the sun in front of the lecture hall.

So: Yes indeed.

1. For me, there are just two seasons, winter and summer of course
2. I *really* get a kick out of it, I can't understand how people come to use public transportation all the time when there's *any* way to go by bike
3. Quoting Barney Stinson here
