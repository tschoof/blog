There's one thing about OS X (and iOS) that annoys me. The animations just take too much time.

* Safari's 'Show all Tabs' gesture
	* *pinch to zoom out* - all the tabs, nice!
	* *swipe* - yeah, that's the tab I want!
	* *tap to click* - nothing happens!

You have to wait half a second or so before a tap is recognized as a click, which makes that whole tab view unusable for me.

* 'Swipe between full-screen apps' animation duration
	* *swipe* - oh, desktop incoming, nice!
	* *wait* - oh, yeah, still moving, so smooth!
	* *slamming the mouse at the bottom of the screen to show the dock* - oh, the desktop is still moving, so smooth and **slowly**. 

The animation is faster when you swipe really hasty. But swiping so that it's fast enough is just ridiculous.

Yeah, I use tap to click and hide the dock. Gestures should be usable at high speed anyway. I have the same problem on the iPad: Some of the animations just take so much time. I love the 5 finger pinch to home screen gesture, but I always have to wait for it to end before being able to launch the next app I wanna use.
