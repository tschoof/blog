Say what you will about Russel Brand, I do like his attitude. He's authentic and is *saying* something meaningful in an *interview*. He totally gets that he's not the leader of a revolution, but also that he doesn't have to act dumb because he's an **actor**.  
Check out the [short piece on gawker](http://gawker.com/russell-brand-may-have-started-a-revolution-last-night-1451318185) about the interview.

Weirdly fitting words by [Mark Sample](https://twitter.com/samplereality):

> "Low point" is the term for when the worst part of a disaster has come to pass. Our disasters increasingly have no low point.

> After the low point of a disaster is reached, things begin to get better. When there is no clear low point, society endures chronic trauma.

> Disasters with no clear low point: global warming, mass extinction, colony collapse disorder, ocean acidification, Fukushima.
