*Pumping Iron* is a 1977 documentary about bodybuilding, or rather about Arnold Schwarzenegger winning his sixth Mr. Olympia title. At the time, the documentary boosted Schwarzenegger's image. I find that fascinating, as I was repulsed by it. Albeit not because of the insight into the world of bodybuilding, but how openly Schwarzenegger talks, even brags about how he manipulates competitors.  
This is him having breakfast with Lou Ferrigno, his competitor, and Lou's parents. Lou's father was also his trainer.

Schwarzenegger also explicitly says that he'd give Franco Columbu, a competitor he was friends with, wrong advice to have an advantage. Call me naive, but I think these aren't very good traits, for nobody. 

Schwarzenegger also explains how in order not to be vulnerable to any kind of negative impact, he basically shut down his emotions. To the point that when his father died two months before a competition, he wasn't affected by it. Overall, Schwarzenegger might be an A+ example of [toxic masculinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_masculinity).

Now, this is me with today's morality standards judging something that happened 40 years ago, right? Unfair! Well, most google results seem to [celebrate](http://ignorelimits.com/psychological-warfare/) Schwarzenegger for his ["psychological warfare"](http://www.businessinsider.com/arnold-schwarzeneggers-psychological-warfare-2015-2?IR=T), instead of [calling it out for what it is: "manipulative and shallow"](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/05/24/arnold-schwarzenegger-8-crazy-scenes-from-pumping-iron-his-1977-documentary.html).

Schwarzenegger says that he sees these methods as "*tools that are available, so you might as well use them*". I'd argue that whoever sees degrading an opponent as just another tool for succes, just as rubbing some oil on muscles, makes the competition about ruthlessness instead of bodybuilding.

Again, am I naive? It's not that easy. I am not against being good at what you do, I am not at all against fair competition. This behaviour, as well as celebrating it, is simply unethical and leads down a very dark path.

Even from a strictly competitive point of view it doesn't make sense: Do you want a good bodybuilder (if you want one at all), or someone who is good at messing with other people's heads? Mind you, in order to protect oneself from that kind of manipulation, they simply need to turn off their emotions. Oh, sweet success!

So let me reiterate: Do you want a good bodybuilder, or an emotionally starved jock (or say... Terminator) who will do anything to succeed? 

Of course, this is also an argument for diversity, tolerance and openness. First of all, these are the right values whatever you're doing. Second of all, and a selling point in a capitalist world: You build better products with these in mind.  
If a team for a health app is 95% dudes, they're gonna [forget that half of the earth's population menstruates](https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/09/apple-stops-ignoring-womens-health-with-ios-9-healthkit-update-now-featuring-period-tracking/). If your only value is success at all cost, you have already lost humanity, and you'll lose in the market place in the long term as well.

Amazing, what a 40-year old documentary about bodybuilding can teach us about diversity and feminism.
