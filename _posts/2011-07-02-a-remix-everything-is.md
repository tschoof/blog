I don't know how, but I managed to oversee all three parts of [**Everything is a Remix**](http://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/).  
Let me embed the first part here to get you hooked,just if you don't already know what I'm talking about.

Am I completely off track here, or does [Kirby Ferguson](http://www.google.de/search?q=Kirby+ferguson&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&client=safari&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=981&bih=632) (at least at the end of part three) look like [Philip Seymour Hoffman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Seymour_Hoffman)'s son?
