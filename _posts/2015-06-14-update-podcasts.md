*Just a few quick thoughts and notes, all podcast-related*

## ungeheuerlich eschoofierend
So, unfortunately, shortly after [my last post on the topic](http://blog.timmschoof.com/2015/03/31/ungeheuerlich-eschoofierend-update/), my podcast [*ungeheuerlich eschoofierend*](http://www.ungeheuerlich.org/) ended. This happens, apparently. While I am sad to let this project go, I am also proud. We started out recording with an iPhone, then got a digital recorder, and finally two Shure SM58s for it. Then I learned how to use Logic Pro X, at least a little, and I think we had a very nice sounding podcast. And we got better with identifying and talking about topics, I think.  
In the last episode, we even did an interview with Johanna, a feminist *outside* our immediate peer group, and had an exchange that really came out very nice (you really should check out this episode: [*ungeheuerlich eschoofierend 028: Sexismus â€“ zu Gast: Johanna Polle*](http://www.ungeheuerlich.org/episoden/028)). 

Currently I'm thinking about ideas for a new podacst project. Something law-related one or the other way may come out of it, but I don't know yet. If you have an idea, [let me know](https://twitter.com/tschoof)!


## Podcasting Community
Anyway, the first **Podcaster Meetup in Hamburg** happened, and I think that's one of the ways the community can continue (or: start, for the cyncics out there) to develop this unique and awesome medium. If you are even only slightly interested in Podcasts and live in or around Hamburg, I urge you to keep an eye on the [meetup group](http://podcasting.meetup.com/cities/de/hamburg/).

And for non-meatspace meetups, there is [*Sendegate*](https://sendegate.de/), a **forum-like place for discussions for the German podcast community**. When I first came across *Sendegate*, it seemed only to be concerned with Podlove-related stuff, but it turns out that's not true. Same here: If you're interested at all, give it a try!

## A Recommendation

After the [accidental tech podcast](http://atp.fm/) had a discussion about women in tech, they did a host-switch with Rocket. Rocket is an awesome tech podcast hosted by Brainna Wu, Christina Warren and Simone De Rochefort. I had listened to the first episode of Rocket and hadn't liked it, but by now they've really found their voice and I really, really like it.  
So, there's a recommendation for an all-female hosted tech podcast: [**Rocket**](https://www.relay.fm/rocket)
