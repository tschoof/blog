I found some memorable quotes in my notes. Here are the ones from the HBO Miniseries [Generation Kill](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995832/). It's about Marines in Iraq, based on the book of the same name by embedded reporter [Evan Wright](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Wright).  
  
  
[Generation Kill Pt. VII, 40:30](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1247757/)  
Ransone
> That was cool. Who do we invade now?

Colbert
> This isn't over, Ray. We don't even know what we've started. We may be here all summer long.
  
  
  
[Generation Kill Pt. VII, 59:08](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1247757/)  
Ryan
> This place was fucked before we got here and it's fucked now. I personally don't believe we liberated the Iraquis. Only time will tell.  

Espera
> I just wish I could go back to that roadblock in Al Hayy. See if those guys I shot in that truck were enemy or just confused. 
 
Fick
> Could have been a tuckload of babies, with our Rules of Engagement you did the right thing.  

Espera
> The priest told me it's not a sin to kill if you don't enjoy killing. My question is whether indifference is the same as enjoyment.   

Colbert
> All religious stuff aside, the fact is people who can't kill will always be subject to those who can.
