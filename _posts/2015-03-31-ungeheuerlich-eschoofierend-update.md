I don't really know why I stopped to post about the podcast my pal Timo and me are doing here – probably because of the different languages, now that I think about it. Meh, who cares?!

While *ungeheuerlich eschoofierend* is somehow getting *zero* traction, it is more and more fun for me: We're getting better at identifying and talking about topics, and there is a trend more towards the 30-minutes episode. 

Inspired by [less than or equal's](http://www.lessthanorequal.com/), we redid our website. It is much more welcoming now, I think. Now there's at least a chance you might care about what Timo and I have to say!  
The website also sports the podlove subscribe button now, an attempt to [make subscribing to podcasts less cumbersome](http://blog.timmschoof.com/2015/02/15/what-it-takes-to-listen-to-a-podcast/).

I am doing the editing, and *boy* is that fun. Audio and audio editing was completely new to me, and I found and still find it interesting to dive in. It's the best and the worst: Every little detail is a potential rabbit hole, from the microphone to the bitrate of the audio file you put out into the world. But it also is tremendous fun, and I honestly think *ue* is a pretty good sounding podcast by now. 

So, if you speak or understand German: [the latest episode of *ungeheuerlich eschoofierend* is about **user interfaces**](http://www.ungeheuerlich.org/episoden/026) – in general, and especially in public toilets. It may be my most siracusa-like performance *yet*. Cheers!
