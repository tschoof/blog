I just want to share some links/articles with you guys.

* [The Oatmeal: This is the web right now](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/state_web_spring) - As always, a fun look on some facts
* Apple's numbers, commented on by [Horace Dediu](http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/35) and [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/2012/04/ipad_sales_context)
* [With The Avengers, Joss Whedon Masters the Marvel Universe](http://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/04/ff_whedon/all/1) - A detailed look at the director of 'The Avengers'. Great stuff by the way, saw it yesterday. A **real** spectacle, nothing more, but nothing less either.
* [My Sluthood, Myself](http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2010/07/26/my-sluthood-myself/) - Oh, something serious. Well. I think this article is a great statement for a healthy view on relationships, love and sex. Quote of the year, for me: *"It means I won’t enter another committed relationship just to satisfy my basic need for sex and affection."*
* [Valve: How I Got Here, What It’s Like, and What I’m Doing](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/abrash/valve-how-i-got-here-what-its-like-and-what-im-doing-2/) - Haven't finished this one yet, but find it very interesting. Fascinating, how some carreers go. Such stories always remind me that it's not too bad I don't have my life planned out until my mid-thirties or even late twenties.
* [Kaley Cuoco Bought a Shake Weight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C88Ydagh0Q) - Thx, [Markus](https://twitter.com/#!/fliegermarkus).
* [John Siracusa on Pasta](http://siracusa.tumblr.com/post/17646045922/better-pasta) - Just some great advice. It's the little things that make pasta dishes great.
* [Sascha Lobo reminds us](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/0,1518,827995,00.html) (in German) that the Internet is driven by a few Social Networks and their contents could disappear just now. Just a hint that you might want to host your stuff yourself.
