[This](http://9to5mac.com/2012/06/04/apple-to-update-most-of-its-mac-lineup-and-multiple-accessories-at-wwdc/#vanilla_comments) would be awesome. I remember being pretty impressed by the 2011 MacBook Air's display (128 pixels per inch), though by no means revolutionary nack then and compared to other laptop screens. But *this*? Oh boy.  
I think Apple will reduce the PPI of the Macs' displays compared to iPhone (326 PPI) and iPad (264 PPI) and use the common distance from eye to screen to explain to us why it's still 'retina' (like they did with the iPad). Well, let them do their marketing thing. A Mac display that sports probably more than 220 PPI would be pretty neat. Tim Cook sure wasn't kidding at the iPad event when he proclaimed that 2012 is gonna be a great year for Apple. Can't wait for the WWDC keynote.
