**Update:** I had emailed the support, and they told me this bug was fixed. Good job, Flexibits!

This is my only complaint about Fantastical on iOS so far, [besides the notifications that would be nice to have](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/12/the-fantastical-experiment-is-over/).

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.timmschoof.com/images/fcal.jpg"><img src="https://blog.timmschoof.com/images/fcal.jpg"/></a><br/><small>This is weird.</small></p>

When I took this screenshot, it was December 13th, as you can see from the ‘Tomorrow 14/12/2012’ section. So the 7th with its two events was six days in the past. A double-tap on the bar at the top is supposed to bring me to ’today’, but apparently this special situation (no events for 7 days) causes Fantastical to not have a tile for the 13th.  I hope this counts as a bug gets fixed.

Other than that, I really like the app.
