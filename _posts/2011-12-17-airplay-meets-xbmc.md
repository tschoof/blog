Right now, I'm rocking XBMC 11.0 Eden Beta 1, and [just recognized by accident](http://www.xbmcfreak.nl/en/native-airplay-has-been-merged-into-xbmc/) that it has AirPlay built in. I tried it, it works flawlessly.  
In the current version, it offers video/audio streaming or just the audio, so the problem the article linked to above mentioned has been worked out. Just go to 'System/Network' and 'allow XBMC to receive AirPlay content'.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blog.timmschoof.com/images/airplayxbmc.jpg" title="AirPlay Menu"><img src="https://blog.timmschoof.com/images/airplayxbmc.jpg" alt="AirPlay Menu" /></a><br><small>Just like that.</small></p>

By the way: If you're wondering how the heck to install XBMC on Ubuntu 11.10, here's how: (It's some user's private PPA that offers builds for current Ubuntu versions, since the official PPA is abandoned somehow)

`sudo apt-add-repository ppa:nathan-renniewaldock/xbmc-stable`  
`sudo apt-get update`  
`sudo apt-get install xbmc`

XBMC's also [available for Windows and Mac OS X](http://xbmc.org/download/).
