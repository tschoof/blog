I love Apple for their [duckhead](http://www.smalldog.com/product/75037/apple-duck-head-ac-adapter-plug-connector-end) concept. And I hate them for not selling the different kinds of duckheads individually. Of course, they want me to buy the world traveller pack with six different duckheads for 40â‚¬. Yeah, the *world* traveller might make use of that. But it contains only one adapter of each kind.

More feasible for individuals visiting one specific country is this: Buying the local iPad power adapter. It comes with a power cord and a duckhead, both sporting the national kind of plug. This way, you can charge your iPhone or iPad and MacBook simultaneously.

Talking of power plugs: OMG the UK plugs and sockets are just ridiculous. But everybody should know that by now. I'm just re-realizing that.
