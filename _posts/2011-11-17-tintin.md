I really liked the [Tintin Movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0983193/). The 3D waswell-done: Not too present, but also adding some atmosphere from time to time. The characters are an interesting mix of the original comic characters and what you would imagine to be their 'real' counterparts, but with a slight accent towards their comic part. This way, the totally fantastic scene in which Tintin, Haddock and Snowy try to get the three pieces of paper from the evil guys comes across just right - like part of a fantstic adventure story.

Here's an unofficial title sequence somebody mentioned on twitter, lovely
