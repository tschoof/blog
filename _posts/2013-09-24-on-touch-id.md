Naturally, Touch ID was defeated ([By the CCC, yay Germany!](http://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2013/ccc-breaks-apple-touchid#.Uj9Bk6z0SqM.twitter)) in only a matter of hours after the iPhone 5S was available. And people are all over it. Bottom line: This end-user product doesn't provide military-grade security. Oh, surprise.

*See!? Using biometric for security doesn't make sense!*

Duh, of course it's hackable, but it's better than **nothing**, and pin codes are a pain in the ass!

*But it's so easy!*

Only if you're the FBI!

*Or a private eye!*

Dude, nobody's saying it's perfect, but it's better than a pin code nobody is using!

A level of security that is annoying and therefore not used is weaker than weak security, got it? [Apparently not](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/defeating-apples-touch-id-its-easier-than-you-may-think/):

No offense, but somebody's in need of a reality check here.

Spending quite some time in university libraries, I see people leaving their laptops unattended, user accounts logged in and sure as hell with all their passwords (pardon: the one password) readily available in Chrome's preferences.

Considering that, I can't believe we're having a discussion about somebody going to the lengths of obtaining and forging your finger print. I can't remember where Iâ€˜ve read it, but: If you're facing *that*, you have way more to worry about than your phone's contents.
