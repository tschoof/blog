It's warm, the sun's shining. I'm on the train from Pinneberg, where my sister lives<sup>1</sup>, to Hamburg, where I live and later am meeting with some friends to have a nice evening<sup>2</sup>. Today, I got back good results from a term paper, now I'm sitting here, listening to my favorite band and writing it down. Life's sweet.

I sincerely hope you forgive me this one pathetic 'Oh my god my life's so awesome right now'-post. Have a great weekend.
