Damn, I wanted this to be a short, funny post, mocking Rambo's choice of allies. Then, I recognized that [Mujahideen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahideen) and [Taliban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban) aren't the same at all, quite the contrary.

Looks like [Rambo III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_III) has educational value after all. If you didn't know the first thing about Afghanistan, like me (good thing history was my intensive course in upper school).
