### Custom 404 Page ###

## Custom 404 Page ##
>>>>>>> gh-pages
Recently, I was inspired by a pic [Mike Monteiro](https://twitter.com/#!/mike_FTW) shared on twitter: the [dribblle 404 page](http://dribbble.com/404). I immediately wanted one of those! So I began, and some coding, texting and a flickr search on [search.creativecommons.org](http://search.creativecommons.org/#) later, there it was.

Now, how to 'deploy' your 404 page in a way that overrides the ugly standard apache-or-whatever-you're-using-standard page?

* Git-hosted Jekyll
	* Generally, if you're using Jekyll and host on github pages, just put a 404.html file in the root directory of your repository. [They say](http://pages.github.com/) that's sufficient.
* Random host
	* When your site's hosted with a more beefed up provider, you propably have access to a .htaccess file.
	* [Basically](http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/sitemanagement/custom404error.html), you need to put a .htaccess file in your site's root directory,
	* put the line 
> ErrorDocument 404 /nameofyourcustom404page.html  

		in it  
   * and of course: create the custom 404 page and upload it to your root directory.
* Hosteurope
  * My page's hosted with hosteurope. Since [querbeet-deluxe.com](http://querbeet-deluxe.com) and its wordpress with all its sql databeses will be abandoned, I don't really need all the feautures of the webpack I'm currently paying for. But I didn't get to make the switch to github pages or S3 or whatever may be out there.
  * With hosteurope, there's a [guide](http://faq.hosteurope.de/index.php?cpid=10942) for customizing your 404 page. I guess that's because they don't want to let you control the .htaccess file. Well, it works.
