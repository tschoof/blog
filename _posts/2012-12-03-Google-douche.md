[Great short piece from last week in *Wired*](http://www.wired.com/business/2012/11/tech-trickle-down/):

> I’ve heard the term “Google douche” used at parties to describe young tech workers in the city who seem irritatingly unaware of the sense of privilege they project simply because they can so easily afford to live there.

Interesting effects of the boom in tech on society.
