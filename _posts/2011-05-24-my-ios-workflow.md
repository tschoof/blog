As you might have recognized, I'm an Ubuntu user. But I also like using Apple Hardware. This results in some special configurations and workarounds. In addition to that, I always find it interesting to see how other people handle tasks of all kind on their devices, even with a standard setup like iOS device + iMac. Lately, a friend of mine and already-iPhone-user discovered that he **needs**<sup>1</sup> an iPad, so I want to give some advice. Maybe I can help you avoiding unnecessary testing, allowing more acutal using, too.  
### Texts ###
I came to the conclusion that notes I can search through (read: taken with the iPad) are more valuabe to me than notes I took with pen and paper. It certainly isn't for everyone, but I'm willing to trade some adjustments in the way I take notes for the comfort of having them all with me on the iPad and Dropbox<sup>2</sup>. For this purpose, I use [**Elements**](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elements-dropbox-powered-text/id382752422?mt=8). Of course it syncs with Dropbox. One of its perks is that it's able to understand and convert to [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), John Gruber's markup language. Don't know what that means? Me neither. It's an easy way to write down HTML, that's all you need to know. This way, I can look up all the notes I took while attending lectures. Saved my ass several times.  
Sadly, Elements seems to write some invisible stuff at the beginning of a text document, so that the markdown-engines Jekyll (the site generator I use for this blog) uses can't handle files just edited with Elements. I'll have to find a better solution for this, but for now I use another Dropbox-syncing text editor for Blogposts, [**Nocs**](http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/id396073482?mt=8).

1. As much as you can **need** a gadget. 
2. Of course, all the documents I need and use are stored in Dropbox. Needless to say that if you don't already use Dropbox, you **need** to do so. [Sign up](http://db.tt/X3XjJMl).
