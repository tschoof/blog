In case you didn't hear, Paul Miller left the Internet for a year. [Now he's back](http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/1/4279674/im-still-here-back-online-after-a-year-without-the-internet), and there's not that much more to it. The sky is still blue, and at the end of the day (or a year), you still are who you are and you do what you do.

However, I think it's a valuable service to our community what Paul did. Now we can cross it off the list and admit to ourselves what we knew all along:

> But at least I'll know that it's not the internet's fault. I'll know who's responsible, and who can fix it. 

Thies totally ties in with [abandoning smartphones](http://blog.timmschoof.com/2013/02/05/smartphone-angst/) and [technological conservatism](http://hypercritical.co/2013/04/07/technological-conservatism).
