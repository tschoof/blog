I've always wanted to, and now am, doing a podcast! [Timo](http://twitter.com/theuer) and me talk about... tech in general, and some other stuff - yeah, about Apple, too. It's in German, but I have no idea what percentage of visitors on my blog is from abroad, so I announce it here anyway.

I'll dedicate a blogpost to every new episode and its contents, but on the sidebar there's a new link, '[Podcast](http://blog.timmschoof.com/podcast/)'. You'll find all the episodes there, in one place.  
If you're already sold and wanna feed a feed to your podcasting app: [Audio RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ungeheuerlich_eschoofierend).  
If you prefer listening to podcasts via iTunes: [This way](http://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/ungeheuerlich-eschoofierend/id507224771?l=en). You can also leave us a rating or a review there, we'd love that.

In the [first episode](http://www.buzzsprout.com/5450/42499-ist-das-irgendwas-auf-servern.mp3), we talk about iMessage, some iPhone history, accents and our nonexistent knowledge about newsgroups, usenet and the early days of the Internet in general. Enjoy!
